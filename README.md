# Data Science Resource List 

Learning new things has become more accesible now due to the plethora of material available online. This is particularly the case for Data Science and Machine Learning. Since I got interested in the field, I have come across a huge amount of learning material which I found immensely useful. This is an attempt to put them togther and make it accesible to others.    
There are many wonderful resources which Professors have put up online and this is an attempt to catalogue these awesome resources. It has been already done by Prakhar on[`Github`](https://github.com/prakhar1989/awesome-courses), which is suited to `Software Engineering`, so the below list is an attempt to list down resources  pertaining to `Data Science` and focussed more on `R` software language. I plan to add more Python Material going forward. 

Hope you find this list useful.

## Courses

[**R Studio Online Tutorial**](https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/) 

[INFO 201A](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1100121) **Technical Foundations of Informatics** *University of Washington* ![lecture](lecture.png) ![readings](reading.png)

* This course introduces fundamental tools and technologies necessary to transform data into knowledge. We'll cover skill associated with each component of the information lifecycle, including the collection, storage, analysis, and visualization of data. Core competencies underlying this process, including functional programming, use of databases, data wrangling, version control, and command line proficiency, are acquired through real-world data-driven assignments
