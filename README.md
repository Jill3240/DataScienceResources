# Data Science Resource List 

Learning new things has become more accesible now due to the plethora of material available online. This is particularly the case for Data Science and Machine Learning. Since I got interested in the field, I have come across a huge amount of learning material which I found immensely useful. This is an attempt to put them togther and make it accesible to others.    
There are many wonderful resources which Professors have put up online and this is an attempt to catalogue these awesome resources. It has been already done by Prakhar on[`Github`](https://github.com/prakhar1989/awesome-courses), which is suited to `Software Engineering`, so the below list is an attempt to list down resources  pertaining to `Data Science` and focussed more on `R` software language. I plan to add more Python Material going forward. 

Hope you find this list useful.

[INFO 201A](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1100121) **Technical Foundations of Informatics** *University of Washington* ![lecture](lecture.png) ![readings](reading.png)

* This course introduces fundamental tools and technologies necessary to transform data into knowledge. We'll cover skill associated with each component of the information lifecycle, including the collection, storage, analysis, and visualization of data. Core competencies underlying this process, including functional programming, use of databases, data wrangling, version control, and command line proficiency, are acquired through real-world data-driven assignments

[DS 101](http://web.stanford.edu/class/stats101/) **Data Science 101** *Stanford University* ![lecture](lecture.png) ![readings](reading.png) ![assignments](assignments.png)

* The course provides a solid introduction to data science, both exposing students to computational tools they can proficently use to analyze data and exploring the conceptual challenges of inferential reasoning. Each module/week represents a new “data adventure,” analyzing real datasets, exploring different questions and trying out tools.

[Stat 48N](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~sabatti/Stat48/) **Riding the data wave** *Stanford University* ![lecture](lecture.png) ![readings](reading.png) ![assignments](assignments.png)

*  How can we make sense of all the information we are acquiring about ourselves? During each week, we will consider a different data set to be summarized with a different goal. We will review analyses of similar problems carried out in the past and explore if and how the same tools can be useful today. We will pay attention to contemporary media (newspapers, blogs, etc.) to identify settings similar to the ones we are examining and critique the displays and summaries there documented

[Stats 200](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~sabatti/Stat200/index.html) **Introduction to Statistical Inference** *Stanford University* ![lecture](lecture.png) ![readings](reading.png) ![assignments](assignments.png)

*  The class will introduce the students to formal statistical reasoning. Building on knowledge of probability and calculus, we will explore how limited noisy observations can be used to learn general characteristics of a population. We will study the basics of decision theory, including frequentist and Bayesian solutions to the "paradox of induction."

*  The goal of this short course is to familiarize students with R’s tools for scientific computing. Class lectures will have interactive elements, and assignments will be application-driven.Topics covered include basic data structures, file I/O, control structures, functions, visualizations, packages for statistical analysis.
