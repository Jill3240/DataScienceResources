# Data Science Resource List 

Learning new things has become more accesible now due to the plethora of material available online. This is particularly the case for Data Science and Machine Learning. Since I got interested in the field, I have come across a huge amount of learning material which I found immensely useful. This is an attempt to put them togther and make it accesible to others.    
There are many wonderful resources which Professors have put up online and this is an attempt to catalogue these awesome resources. It has been already done by Prakhar on[`Github`](https://github.com/prakhar1989/awesome-courses), which is suited to `Software Engineering`, so the below list is an attempt to list down resources  pertaining to `Data Science` and focussed more on `R` software language. I plan to add more Python Material going forward. 

Hope you find this list useful.

* Understand the distinction between supervised and unsupervised learning and be able to identify appropriate tools to answer different research questions.
* Become familiar with basic unsupervised procedures including clustering and principal components analysis.
* Become familiar with the following regression and classification algorithms: linear regression, ridge regression, the lasso, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, K-nearest neighbors, splines, generalized additive models, tree-based methods, and support vector machines.
* Gain a practical appreciation of the bias-variance tradeoff and apply model selection methods based on cross-validation and bootstrapping to a prediction challenge.
* Analyze a real dataset of moderate size using R.
* Develop the computational skills for data wrangling, collaboration, and reproducible research.
* Be exposed to other topics in machine learning, such as missing data, prediction using time series and relational data, non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques, web-based data visualizations, anomaly detection, and representation learning.

[Statistics 36-350](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/statcomp/) **Statistical Computing: Spring 2018** *Carnegie Mellon University* ![lecture](lecture.png) ![readings](reading.png) ![assignments](assignments.png)

* Computational data analysis is an essential part of modern statistics. Competent statisticians must not just be able to run existing programs, but to understand the principles on which they work. They must also be able to read, modify, and write code, so that they can assemble the computational tools needed to solve their data analysis problems, rather than distorting problems to fit tools provided by others. This class is an introduction to statistically-oriented programming, targeted at statistics majors, without assuming extensive programming background

*  This course introduces mathematical optimization and modeling, with a focus on convex optimization. Topics include: varieties of mathematical optimization, convexity of functions and sets, convex optimization modeling with CVXPY, gradient descent and basic distributed optimization, in-depth examples from machine learning, statistics and other fields and applications of bi-convexity and non-convex gradient descent.
